# MIDI to Keyframes Blender addon

This is a free Blender addon to import MIDI files and generate animation keyframes. It assigns the keyframes to objects you assign as piano keys.

> On some devices like Mac you may need to give elevated permissions to Blender to allow for plugin to work. This is because we need to install a library to read MIDI files inside Blender.

## Installation

1. Download as a zip
1. Open Blender
1. Go to Edit > Preferences and go to the Addons tab on left.
1. Click install button.
1. Select the zip you downloaded.
1. You can confirm it's installed by searching for "MIDI to Keyframes" and seeing if it's checked off

One last thing, you'll need to press 1 more button:

1. Open up the side panel labeled **"MIDI Import"**, it's available in the 3D viewport in the n-panel (the right side panel that's usually collapsed).
1. Click the button labeled **"Install Dependencies"**.
1. Done!

## How to use

1. Open up the side panel labeled **"MIDI Import"**, it's available in the 3D viewport in the n-panel (the right side panel that's usually collapsed).
1. Select a MIDI file you'd like to import.
1. Assign 3D objects to piano keys.
1. Click the button labeled **"Generate Keyframes"**

## How it works
