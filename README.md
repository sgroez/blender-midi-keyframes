# Blender Gamepad Input Addon

An example of how to get gamepad and other device input (like MIDI maybe) and use it inside Blender.

> On some devices like Mac you may need to give elevated permissions to Blender to allow for plugin to work.

## How to use

1. Download as a zip
1. Open Blender
1. Go to Edit > Preferences and go to the Addons tab on left.
1. Click install button.
1. Select the zip you downloaded.
1. You can confirm it's installed by searching for "Gamepad" and seeing if it's checked off

## How it works

TBD.

Uses `inputs` Python library to get gamepad input data across all platforms (Windows, Linux, and Mac).
